    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      This is a blog about the interaction between the Gilmore Girls TV show and
      technology.
    </p>
    <p>

      technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, writing a television show during a period of great technological
      change between 1999 and 2007, it was impossible for her to ignore
      technology entirely.
